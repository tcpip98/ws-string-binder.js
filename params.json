South Korea is located in East Asia.\r\n````\r\n  \r\n  \r\n#### Associative Binding with JSON object\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\nvar bindings = { \"city\" : \"Seoul\"\r\n               , \"country\" : \"South Korea\"\r\n               , \"location\" : \"East Asia\"\r\n               };\r\nvar output = \"The {city} is the capital of {country}. {country} is located in {location}.\"\r\n             .$bind( bindings );\r\n// output : The Seoul is the capital of South Korea. South Korea is located in East Asia.\r\n````\r\n  \r\n  \r\n#### Append strings\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\nvar output = \"My name is\"\r\n             .$append( \"Jake Wonsang Lee\" );\r\n             .$append( \".\" );\r\n// output : My name is Jake Wonsang Lee.\r\n````\r\n  \r\n  \r\n#### Prepend strings\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\nvar output = \"is his e-mail address.\"\r\n             .$prepend( \" \" )\r\n             .$prepend( \"tcpip98@gmail.com\" );\r\n// output : tcpip98@gmail.com is his e-mail address.\r\n````\r\n  \r\n","google":"UA-71563347-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
